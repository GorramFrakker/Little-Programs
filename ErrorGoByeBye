This program takes a screenshot whenever Microsoft Access errors
out and emails it.

# Load the System.Drawing assembly
[Reflection.Assembly]::LoadWithPartialName("System.Drawing") | Out-Null

# Define the screenshot file path
$filePath = "C:\screenshots\error.png"

# Capture the screenshot
$bmp = New-Object System.Drawing.Bitmap(1000, 700)
$graphics = [System.Drawing.Graphics]::FromImage($bmp)
$graphics.CopyFromScreen(0,0,0,0, $bmp.Size)
$bmp.Save($filePath, [System.Drawing.Imaging.ImageFormat]::Png)

# Define the email properties
$from = "sender@example.com"
$to = "recipient@example.com"
$subject = "Error Screenshot"
$body = "Attached is a screenshot of the error that occurred."
$smtpServer = "smtp.example.com"
$port = 587

# Send the email with the attachment
Send-MailMessage -From $from -To $to -Subject $subject -Body $body -SmtpServer $smtpServer -Port $port -UseSsl -Credential (Get-Credential) -Attachments $filePath

This script captures a screenshot of the entire screen
and sends it as an email whenever it is run. To integrate it with Windows Error
Reporting, you'll need to schedule the script to run automatically using the Windows Task Scheduler whenever an error message appears.

Note: You'll need to replace the $from, $to, $smtpServer, #and other variables with the appropriate values for your email setup, and specify valid login credentials for the email account being used to send the email.

Windows Task Scheduler Creation.
This will make thos all automatic.

Here's how you can schedule the script to run automatically:

Open the Windows Task Scheduler
Click on "Create Task"
Enter a name for the task, such as "Error Screenshot"
Under the "Triggers" tab, click on "New"
Set the trigger to run the task whenever an error message appears, for example, whenever a specific event is logged in the Windows Event Viewer.
Under the "Actions" tab, click on "New"
Set the action to start a program, and enter the path to the PowerShell executable and the script file as the argument.
Save the task and close the Task Scheduler.
From now on, the script will run automatically whenever an error message appears, capturing a screenshot and sending it as an email.
